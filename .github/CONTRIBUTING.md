## Thank you for considering contributing to this application. We really do appreciate the effort! =)
Please take a few moments to read the below before submitting a PR.

## Contributing code 101
 
This guide will show you the mechanics of working on your forked project, and submitting your changes to this 'upstream' repository for a pull request <https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/>

## Guidelines specific to this application

* Ensure that each pull request only contains the changes relevant to your patch or enhancement. If you stumble upon a separate bug you'd like to fix, or decide to help out by refactoring some other code, it is important to separate this out into its own pull request.
* Make sure you branch is ahead of 'master' and not trailing several commits behind. We didn't write your code and the surrounding code isn't likely to be fresh in our minds, so we'd prefer not to have to try to resolve conflicts introduced during a rebase or a merge.
* This application doesn't have much in the way of test cases (maybe even none at all), but please consider writing some for your code. We will catch up and do the same for the wider code base as time permits, so this will be very helpful. Please try to stick to using test dependencies such as RSpec, as opposed to something a little too out-of-the-box.
* By contributing to this application, you are transfering us the 'rights' to the code you introduced to the code-base.
